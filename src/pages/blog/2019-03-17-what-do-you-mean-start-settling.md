title: What do you mean start settling?

  So many of our mentors, role models, and life coaches say "Stop settling,
  never settle, keep hustling," "you'll become the next sports-star, celebrity,
  millionaire if you just. Keep. Going." But this becomes a problem when we
  don't become the next Mariah Carey, Michael Jordan, or Kevin Hart. When these
  same idols begin to crumble we wonder how it happened. We put these stars on
  high, then we watch them fall from the sky, asking ourselves and others "why?"

So many of our mentors, role models, and life coaches say "Stop settling, never settle, keep hustling," "you'll become the next sports-star, celebrity, millionaire if you just. Keep. Going." But this becomes a problem when we don't become the next Mariah Carey, Michael Jordan, or Kevin Hart. When these same idols begin to crumble we wonder how it happened. We put these stars on high, then we watch them fall from the sky, asking ourselves and others "why?"

You see, we all hold scars that hurt and haunt us, yet we continue to lie to ourselves and flaunt them. Scar tissue's ability to withstand lacerations, cuts, and openings far out weigh the ability in which normal tissue can. The scars that hurt aren't "scars" at all, just covered up wounds, revealed. What happens in this world terribly malforms who we are created to be. Social status, stigmas, and pressures are just a few minute attributes this world has thrown our way to inhibit us from true success.

True success is not found in what we do, but in the foundation in which it is done in. Without a foundation, we can not build anything that will last. Jesus, being the only true foundation, will never shake in a storm, sway with the winds, or crack under pressure.

That doesn't mean we can't build a terrible structure on the foundation in which God gives us. Imagine if you saw a neighbor put up three sticks and a tarp on a hundred by hundred foot piece of concrete in preparation for a storm. You think to yourself: "even a drizzle might knock it over" After the storm blows through, covered by the three sticks and tarp, your neighbor gets up, curses the concrete for not doing a better job holding the "tent.", and waits for the next storm approaching. This was how I found myself cursing God because of the storm, not realizing it was my fault for not preparing for it. God gives us this foundation to build everything we could ever need off of it and we come to play patty cake on it. PATTY CAKE!

This foundation, while metaphorical, lays the ground for every facet of our lives. Since we don't have to worry about what's beneath us, we can focus on building up. Our community, work, and environment create structure around us so when the storm surrounds us, we'll be ready. It's time to stop sweating, and start settling.

Foundation scriptures: Luke 6:46-49, 1 Corinthians 3:11.
